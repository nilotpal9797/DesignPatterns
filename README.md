# Design Patterns

### Design patterns are design level solutions for recurring problems that frequently occur in software engineering. It is like a description on how to tackle these problems and design a solution.

#### The repo contains implementation, use cases and best practices associated with various design patterns. The theory and code associated with each design pattern can be found in their individual module.


#### Design Patterns can be divided into 3 major categories 
##### 1.) Creational Design Patterns - These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.Examples - Builder Pattern, Factory Pattern etc

#### 2.) Structural Patterns - These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.Examples - Adapter Pattern, Facade Pattern

#### 3.) Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others. Examples - Command Pattern, Observer Pattern etc.
